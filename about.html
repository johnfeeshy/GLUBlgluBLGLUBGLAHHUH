        <h5>about</h5><br>
        <p class="textbox">

            John ‘Feeshy’ Walker is an interdisciplinary artist, curator, designer, and researcher primarily working with new media, video, generative programs, sculpture, and performance art. Across disciplines, his work generally explores issues of technocapitalism, human-computer interactions, and the concept of ‘users.’ 

<br><br>

John is currently an M.A. Candidate in Art History at Virginia Commonwealth University where he is researching contemporary, digital, and new media art and online visual culture. Drawing heavily from theories of human-computer interaction and frameworks of user-experience (UX) design, his current research focuses on critiquing the design-thinking systems present within the contemporary experience of art. Through this research, he is seeking to unpack the power dynamics between users (visitors) of art spaces and the systems (museums, galleries) that control user behavior.
