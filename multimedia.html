                  <br>As the Assistant Director of Art+Technology at Moisturizer Gallery, I spearheaded the development of the Moisturizer Gallery website which began hosting virtual exhibitions as a response to covid-19 restrictions.
            I collaborated with the director on curating, designing, and developing virtual exhibitions. The website is reflective of Moisturizer's intention of being an experimental non-profit art gallery and community space. I pitched the idea of utilizing abandoned JCPenney stores as a constant conceptual design theme throughout the website. I also utilized the original drawing of the lotion bottle character from the Director and recreated it as a 3D model that greets viewers with their super groovy dance moves. The website was entirely designed and developed by myself.

                  <br>
                  <br>“GaleréVR” is a virtual reality-based art gallery created in collaboration with MuséeVR. The purpose of this virtual space is to provide technology-based artists and designers the opportunity to exhibit work in a digital environment. This space is an opportunity for new forms of art production and consumption as it calls for innovative works that do not translate in physical spaces. The space is split into 4 exhibition spaces with a central lobby area along with hallways connecting each of the exhibition spaces. The environment was assembled in Unreal Engine.

      Space Drill Y21K, 2019
        <br>
        interactive arcade game
      <br>
      <br>
      Space Drill Y21K is an interactive modded arcade game that was a part of the Broaden Your Sense of Normal project series/exhibition (see it on my <a href="art.html">art</a> page :)). The piece functions as a preparatory tool for students and school faculty. The the piece is intended to build up the user’s cardio and train complex footwork to prepare them for outrunning a potential active shooter. Through this method of gamification of the larger issue of school shootings, we are paralleling American policies that promote ways of coping/surviving with issues (such as school shootings) rather than solving the underlying issues. The piece acts as an illustrated portrayal of the existing trivialization of the school shooting epidemic whether it be excusing, ignoring, or accepting the violent acts and/or the preceding red flags that lead to the actual act.
      <br>
      <br>
      The arcade cabinet and dance platform were constructed from scratch using CNC machinery and laser cutting procedures. The game itself is a modded version of an open source DDR game that was re-designed with all original graphics. The songs on the machine are sourced from the video game <i> Space Channel 5</i> (1999) and were renamed in the song catalog to be more referential to the contextual significance.

                  The project is a series of works that reflect on the Gen Z experience of growing up amidst violence, mass anxiety, and uncertainty particularly in relation to the American school shooting epidemic. By intertwining experience, fiction, game culture, internet culture, and post-irony to explore themes of denialism, hopelessness, desensitization, inactivity, and persecutory delusion, the work is not only a reflection of the pair’s own experience in relation to American school  shooting culture, but is a portrait of a generation who entered their school years with the rise of school shootings.

                  Originally filmed on location using a RED camera. The footage was then processed through SynthEyes to create motion tracking points which were then exported as a 3D camera and 3D tracking points into Maya. The 3D scene was then created and composited into the environment.

                  Originally inspired by the <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon</i> game series, I was thinking about how one of the most common ways of playing the game is to build theme parks of pain and death. The visitors, programmed to be ignorant to their overseer's intentions, happily obliging to partake in riding a clearly unfinished rollercoaster track destined to crash and burn.
